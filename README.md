## dm-LFO

This is a low frequency oscillator plugin written in Rust.

The effect can be compiled to a [MOD audio](https://mod.audio/) plugin.

## MOD installation

This plugin is not yet in the MOD Audio plugin store.
However, you can download the latest MOD Dwarf build from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-LFO/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.
