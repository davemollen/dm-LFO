## dm-LFO

This is a low frequency oscillator plugin. The only available plugin format is LV2 because it's only designed for use on [MOD devices](https://mod.audio/). More specifically this is a CV plugin that can be used to modulate parameters.

## MOD devices installation

This plugin is not yet in the MOD Audio plugin store.
However, you can find a build of the plugin for the MOD Dwarf at [./lv2/dm-LFO.lv2](./lv2/dm-LFO.lv2/). Copy this file to your MOD devices' plugin folder. If you want a build for MOD Duo or MOD Duo X you'll need to build the plugin yourself for now. For more information about building this plugin for your MOD device, see [these instructions](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder).
